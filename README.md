# NServiceBus.Functions
This is a sample project that demonstrates integration between self-hoted NServiceBus endpoint and an Azure function. In this setup the function plays a role of a handler for `PingCommand`s send from the `Sender` endpoint.

The [function](https://github.com/tmasternak/NServiceBus.Functions/blob/master/NServiceBus.Function/TheFunction.cs) has the following form:

```csharp
[FunctionName("TheFunction")]
public static void Run([NServiceBusTrigger(QueueName = "main-queue")]PingCommand command, NServiceBusCollector collector, TraceWriter log)
{
    log.Info($"NSB function triggered: {command.Text}");

    collector.AddReply(new PongReply{Text = $"Hello {command.Text}. Timestamp: {DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks}"});
}
```

It's tiggered via `NServiceBusTrigger` running on top of ASQ transport that passes the input POCO command. The second arguemnt `NServiceBusCollector` handles messages generated by the function on execution.
